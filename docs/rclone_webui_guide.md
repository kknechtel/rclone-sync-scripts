# Rclone WebUI File Transfer Guide

## Navigation in the WebUI

### 1. Access the Explorer
After logging in (admin/admin), look for these options in the menu:
- **Explorer** or **Browse** or **Files** 
- It might be an icon that looks like a folder

### 2. If you don't see file browsing options:

The WebUI might be showing a simplified interface. Try:

1. **Look for a hamburger menu** (three lines â˜°) in the top left
2. **Check for tabs** at the top of the page
3. **Look for icons** in a sidebar

### 3. Alternative: Use the RC (Remote Control) Interface
